I have created a HTTP API service supporting five endpoints. The server supports authentication and authorisation of users. Only admin users have privilege to perform DELETE, PUT and POST operations. The user password is encrypted and stored in the MongoDB database. The users are sent a JSON Web Token when authentication is successful.

# Features:

1. The website lists down different types of plants in the form of a card with images.
2. Provides feature to filter plants based on their type.
3. The shop page provides a search box to search plants by their name.
4. Users will be able to add plants to a cart.
5. Info link on the card to show a modal with plant specific information.
6. Authentication and Authorization.
7. Encryption of user password.
8. POST user cart payload.
9. User details page listing down adoption history.

# Design and Implementation:

I have used following modules for the the features listed down below:

1. Authentication and Authorization - jsonwebtoken : To generate JWT on successful authentication
2. Client and server side validation - joi
3. Encryption - bcrypt
4. Configuration - config
5. Error handling - express-async-errors
